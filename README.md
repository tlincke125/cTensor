The commit I ended with my freshman year was 

bec25956f29d337cbd73be16f7f6ca5c4825abae

This is the commit that contained a "working" neural network - just wasn't very good. In fact the math was pretty much just completely wrong.

This is now a wip - updated readme to come. I've learned a lot about better software development and I want to impliment those changes and make this more extensible.



I'm working on the math currently - located in the python folder. This is an experimental script that I've been changing. It doesn't contain everything I've done.

See https://tlincke125.github.io/nonlinear/ctensor/2020/12/31/cTensor.html for a description of the project I am starting over on.
