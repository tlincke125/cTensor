The commit I ended with my freshman year was 

bec25956f29d337cbd73be16f7f6ca5c4825abae (stored on branch cTensor_beta)

This is the commit that contained a "working" neural network - just wasn't very good or universal, and required opencv for opening images. I removed the Opencv dependency (because all of the linear algebra factorizations and operations were written by me).

This is now a wip - updated readme to come. I've learned a lot about better software development and I want to impliment those changes and make this more extensible.

To see the most recently updated version - visit the branch **ctensor\_version2**
